# About
This is an [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) script which is used to generate models for 3D-printable plant pots with reservoirs to hold excess water. 
The size of the pot can be customized. By tweaking the parameters, the decorative patterning of the pot can also be changed

<br><br>
**Print Parameters:**

No supports needed. PETG is a good material to use, though others should work too. I recommend leak testing the pot with some water before using it.
